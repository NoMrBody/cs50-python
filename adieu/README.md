Adieu Generator

This program prompts the user for names, one per line, until the user inputs control-d.
Then it bids adieu to those names, separating two names with one 'and', three names with
two commas and one 'and', and names with commas and one 'and'.

Example:
    Adieu, adieu, to Liesl
    Adieu, adieu, to Liesl and Friedrich
    Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, and Louisa
    Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, and Kurt
    Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, and Brigitta
    Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, and Marta
    Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl
